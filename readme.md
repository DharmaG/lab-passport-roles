Imagine you just graduated from your Ironhack course and because on how outstanding your performance was,
the boss G.M. decides to offer you to join the I.B.I.

That´s it, the Ironhack Bureau Investigation. Then you can think of yourself doing a lot of cool stuff, hacking the bad guys and making this plante a safer place to live. But on your first day, G.M. comes to see you with bad news: Hey Ironhacker! Last night we´ve been hacked and all our system is out of work. There´s a lot of stuff to fix but I know I can trust you to solve this situation.
First thing first, the boss lost his access over the platform and he needs to take control again to give access to his employees.

First Iteration:
  Rebuild all the platform and make the SUDO to be able to create more "participants". The routes must be protected so only logged in users can access. For the moment foreign users can´t access it, only the superuser can create access.
